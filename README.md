Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning method employed for dimension reduction. It is commonly utilized to generate a representative mapping for the low-dimensional representation of a dataset originally characterized by high dimensionality. The Self-Organizing Map falls under the category of unsupervised learning, as its primary outcome is a map designed to visually represent the clustering of a dataset. This map serves as a tool to visualize and understand the inherent structure or patterns within the data, aiding the identification and exploration of clusters or groupings present in the dataset.

Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) stands as an Artificial Neural Network paradigm drawing inspiration from the intricate workings of biological neural systems. The LVQ algorithm is founded upon the prototype of a classification algorithm derived from supervised learning principles, employing a training method rooted in the competitive learning algorithm. Specifically designed to address multiclass classification challenges, the Learning Vector Quantization modelling algorithm is a valuable tool in discerning patterns and relationships within complex datasets.

The architecture of Learning Vector Quantization comprises two distinct layers, featuring both an input layer and an output layer. This layered structure facilitates the processing of information, with the input layer receiving the raw data and the output layer producing a refined output indicative of the classification or pattern recognition achieved through the learning process. As a result, Learning Vector Quantization serves as an effective and versatile approach for tasks requiring the nuanced classification of data into multiple classes.
