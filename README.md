# Linear-Vector-Quantization-and-Self-Organizing-Map-Project

Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning method employed for dimension reduction. It is commonly utilized to generate a representative mapping for the low-dimensional representation of a dataset originally characterized by high dimensionality. The Self-Organizing Map falls under the category of unsupervised learning, as its primary outcome is a map designed to visually represent the clustering of a dataset. This map serves as a tool to visualize and understand the inherent structure or patterns within the data, aiding the identification and exploration of clusters or groupings present in the dataset.

Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) stands as an Artificial Neural Network paradigm drawing inspiration from the intricate workings of biological neural systems. The LVQ algorithm is founded upon the prototype of a classification algorithm derived from supervised learning principles, employing a training method rooted in the competitive learning algorithm. Specifically designed to address multiclass classification challenges, the Learning Vector Quantization modelling algorithm is a valuable tool in discerning patterns and relationships within complex datasets.

The architecture of Learning Vector Quantization comprises two distinct layers, featuring both an input layer and an output layer. This layered structure facilitates the processing of information, with the input layer receiving the raw data and the output layer producing a refined output indicative of the classification or pattern recognition achieved through the learning process. As a result, Learning Vector Quantization serves as an effective and versatile approach for tasks requiring the nuanced classification of data into multiple classes.

## The Training Method of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)


The dataset employed in this project is the Iris Dataset, comprising 150 data points. Throughout the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) training process, given that LVQ operates as a supervised learning method, the network undergoes training by being presented with inputs in the form of training patterns representing the various classes. These training patterns are derived from the initial distribution of output classes, providing the network with labeled examples to learn from. Subsequent to the training phase, Learning Vector Quantization employs this acquired knowledge to classify input vectors by associating them with the appropriate output class. In essence, the input vector is mapped to the corresponding output unit, reflecting the class to which it has been classified based on the learning achieved during the training process.
